# webpack-example-app
Learning purposes.

## Why?
Whith a webpack built app, I need to be able to change CSS or JavaScript in an external folder
without compiling the app everytime something is changed.

Created a simple example app using the guides from [webpack documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/usage.html).

Commited every step along the way with a meaningful message in order to easily navigate through the evolution of the project.

## Test it locally:
Checkout or fork this repo and install the dependencies.
```shell
cd app/
npm install
```
Run webpack
```shell
npm run build
```

Open `app/index.html` in your browser.

Change anything in `ext/` and refresh the browser.
